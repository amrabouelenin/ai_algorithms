# Algorithms to solve poular AI proplems and others subjects

This section contains several Algorithms to solve different problems, and it contains my learning experience with AI using python.


## Subjects:

* Travel sales man Problem (TSP).
* Tetris Game.

## Algorithms tested for TSP

* Bredth First Search (BFS).
* Depth First Search (DFS).
* Dijkstra Algorithm.
* Nearest Neighbour.

Note: you may need to tweek the algorithms a little bit to fit your solution, but you have to get the concept first in mind before copying and pasting the code.
